Crystals Collector Game!

This is a simple guessing game where the user needs to match their total crystal score to the target score.

You increase your total crystal score by clicking on one of the crystals below. Each crystal has a different number value that will add to the total score.

If the total crystal number = the target score, you win. If you go over, you lose.

Wins are recorded in the wins catagory and losses are recorded in the losses catagory. 

The game restarts once you either win or lose.
